I have collected many notes and useful stuff into a single folder for putting onto an SD card.
Content might include images of schematics, assembly instructions, and sample sketches for testing various MaxDuino functions.
(Note these may depend on certain libraries being avaialble in your Arduino IDE. You can download them with the library manager.)



=============
Sound Effects
=============
Your sound files must be copied into the folder called mp3 in the order you want them to play.
For ease of reference they should start with a numeric digits in the name as shown .. BUT ...
be aware it as actually the order they are copied onto the memory card that is important. 
Therefore copy the files one at a time to the memory card using the numbers to set the order.

For example
01.mp3
02.mp3
03 My Third Sound Clip.mp3

A few useful sources of sound effects I have found:

SoundBible	    SoundBible.com	                                Good. d/l did not work in Chrome, Microsoft Edge ok
Salami Sounds	https://www.salamisound.com/top-downloads	    Good
Freesound	    https://freesound.org/	                        Mostly personal recordings - not sound FX as such
ZapSplat        https://www.zapsplat.com/	                    Many sound FX as packs which is a challenge to browse.
BBC             https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/          Many sound effects. Free (but check their terms and conditions anyway)
